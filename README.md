# Fitness Level Classification 🏋️‍♂️

A machine learning project that predicts *fitness levels* (multiclass classification) based on health, activity, and lifestyle data.  
This project was developed as part of my MSc Data Science coursework.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
•⁠  ⁠Applied *multiclass classification* techniques to categorize fitness levels.
•⁠  ⁠Dataset includes features such as *age, gender, height, weight, activity type, duration, intensity, calories burned, stress level, daily steps, hydration level, and health condition*.
•⁠  ⁠Models implemented:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - K-Means Clustering (unsupervised comparison)

---

## 📊 Key Results
•⁠  ⁠Preprocessing: scaling, encoding, and feature selection.
•⁠  ⁠Achieved improved accuracy with ensemble methods.
•⁠  ⁠Visualized results using confusion matrices and clustering plots.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
•⁠  ⁠Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
•⁠  ⁠Jupyter Notebook
